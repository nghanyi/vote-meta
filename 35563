It’s been 3 months since we had a vote, and since then we have seen:

- A major JUP distribution involving Jupuary #2, to 1.2M users
- Q4 2024’s ASR claim, going towards existing voters
- Catstanbul, our first major conference

Right before the upcoming votes for the rest of Q1 2025, the Jupiter Team has proposed a fun logo vote to rally the community and welcome the new voters to the DAO!
