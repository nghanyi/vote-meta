Over the last year, Jupiter expanded its team with ~65 top-tier leaders to drive jup.ag, jupiverse, and jupnet. Base salaries are always funded via USDC from the team treasury. But for alignment, we need 280M JUP over 3 years.

Options:

1. Option 1 - Fund with Strategic Reserve (Default): Unlock 280M JUP from the team-managed Strategic Reserve starting July 2025.
2. Option 2 - Max Long-Term Meow Alignment: Meow funds it with his personal 280M JUP, reclaims it from Strategic Reserve in 2030 and requests a 220M JUP bonus from the Community Reserve in 2030.
   - Veto: Community can veto the bonus anytime before 2030 if meow's performance is deemed unsatisfactory.
3. Option 3 - No Net Emissions + No Bonus: Meow funds it personally and reclaims 280M JUP from the Strategic Reserve in 2027, no bonus.

Key Points:

- Purpose: New talent will fuel Jupiter’s growth in liquidity, community, and tech.
- Transparency: All options prioritize accountability; Option 2 adds community veto power.
- Alignment: Ties team and community goals for long-term success.
