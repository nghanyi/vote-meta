Following the first Jupuary vote that did not pass, the team has reviewed all the verified feedback from voters. This vote is for checking if the community is comfortable with the updated Jupuary proposal with the following key changes from the original proposal:

- Portion of the allocation will go into incentivizing holding, buying and voting through the year. Unclaimed JUP will also go into ASR.  
- There will be an explicit allocation for stakers, with bonus for historical consistency.
- We will be hyper focused on including as many real users as possible, using key parameters like actual holdings, participation in the ecosystem, and consistency/place of usage. Notably, unlike the first Jupuary, bots will be explicitly excluded.

Similar to the previous vote, the team will be seeking a 70% yes vote in order to ensure broad-based support from the community for Jupuary. Also, you will still be able to leave your feedback after casting your vote. You may also optionally include your email address so that the team can reach you to discuss your feedback.

Hopefully the community is able to unify around Jupuary with this updated proposal!
